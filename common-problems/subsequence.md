# Subsequence Problems

### Type
String / Array Problems


### Definition
A subsequence is a string generated from a larger string

### Typical Time / Space Complexity
Time complexity is generally O(n^2)

### How to Approach

Usually want to use a 1D or 2D dynamic programmic array. Use a 1D array where one string is involved and a 2D array where two strings are involved.

### Common Operations / Implementation
